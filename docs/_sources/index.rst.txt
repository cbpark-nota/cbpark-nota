LaunchX
=======

LaunchX is a web application that facilitates the essential tasks of framework conversion and benchmarking for deploying AI models on devices quickly and easily. It allows AI developers, researchers, and even non-coders to intuitively use the ultimate converter and benchmarker. If you are a Python user, you can access the same functionality as a Python package through `NetsPresso <https://github.com/Nota-NetsPresso/PyNetsPresso/>`_.

Models
------

We provide optimized models through NetsPresso. You can immediately utilize these AI models after converting them.

- Utilize a variety of computer vision task models for free.
- You can download converted models.
- You can request customization for a fine-tuned model that is tailored to your project environment.

Convert
-------
Simplify the process of framework conversion.

.. image:: _images/launchx_convert.png

- Easy and efficient model conversion.
- Eliminate trial and error with automated conversion.
- Quickly set up the deployment of models on target devices.
  :ref:`See supported frameworks <compatible_model_scope>`

Benchmark
---------
Easily find the right device for your AI model.

.. image:: _images/launchx_benchmark.png

- Identify the best-fit device through benchmarking.
- Check model compatibility with target devices.
- Evaluate real-device performance without acquiring or setting up the device.

Request your device
-------------------
We continuously research and develop to optimize AI models whenever new devices are released through partnerships with device manufacturers. If you have a specific device you'd like to benchmark, please make a `request <https://notaai.typeform.com/to/n6yVxFov?typeform-source=launchx.netspresso.ai/>`_ to us.

We hear from you
