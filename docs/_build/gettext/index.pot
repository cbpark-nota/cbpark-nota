msgid "LaunchX is a web application that facilitates the essential tasks of framework conversion and benchmarking for deploying AI models on devices quickly and easily. It allows AI developers, researchers, and even non-coders to intuitively use the ultimate converter and benchmarker. If you are a Python user, you can access the same functionality as a Python package through `NetsPresso <https://github.com/Nota-NetsPresso/PyNetsPresso/>`_."
