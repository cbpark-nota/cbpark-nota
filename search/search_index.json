During the app development, we realized how painful it was to optimize the deep learning model on a tiny mobile device. That experience lead us to the decision to share our know-hows with other developers not only to build, but optimize models per a particular hardware. Since then, Nota has focused on deep learning optimization technology and will continue to develop its AI software optimization platform to support AI developer community. Nota has offices in South Korea, US, and Germany and partners with over 35 global market leaders from a wide range of industries including system integrator, device manufacturers, platform providers, and mobility.</p> <p>\ud83c\udfe0\u00a0More about Nota</p>"},{"location":"#contact-us","title":"Contact us","text":"<p>If you have any questions or comments, please contact us.</p> <p>We look forward to your feedback.</p> <p>\ud83d\ude4f Leave Feedbacks:\u00a0NetsPresso Discussion Forum</p> <p>\ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83d\udcbb NetsPresso Support Center:\u00a0netspresso@nota.ai</p>"},{"location":"LaunchX/features_and_scope_of_support/","title":"Features &amp; Scope of support","text":"<p>LaunchX is a web application that facilitates the essential tasks of framework conversion and benchmarking for deploying AI models on devices quickly and easily.
